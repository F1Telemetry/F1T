#### The overlay won't display over top of F1?
Make sure you follow [these](##how-to-use?) instructions
#### Will this work for F1 2022?
It's likely that when F1 2022 comes out I will update this tool to F1 2022
#### How can I tell there is no malicious code?
Short answer, you can't. You can't trust anything, so I don't blame you. Source code is available and you can have a look through it and compile it yourself. Alternatively, run the executable through a couple anti-virus scanners. If the tool gets popular enough I will look into a better method of assuring there is not malicious code other than "Trust me :)"
#### Will there ever be premium features or a paid version?
No. I have no interest in making this paid. Will most likely always be open source. This is a side/passion project, not a business
#### I have an idea for a feature, but I can't code it...
Suggest it on the [issues page](https://github.com/ryanabaker/F1T/issues "Issues"). There is 0 guarentee that it will ever get looked at or completed, but it is worth a shot
#### Does this work for UNIX/OS X systems?
Not currently
